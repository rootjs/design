\chapter{NodeApplication}
ROOT uses TApplication to interface with the windowing system and event handlers.
An insatnce of TApplication is usually stored in the global \textit{gApplication} variable.

The main problem with using TApplication directly would be, that we could not hook into the \textit{InitializeGraphics} method.
When having a graphical user interface we need to do a UI update frequently:
\begin{verbatim}
gSystem->ProcessEvents();
\end{verbatim}
To avoid having a lot of \textit{ProcessEvents} calls, we wait until \textit{InitializeGraphics} has been called at least once.

Further NodeApplication is being used to set the application's name and initialize a custom message callback which can be used to retrive messages in JavaScript.
